hotsucks-content
================

This repository contains the content for the [HOT Sucks](http://www.hotsucks.com) website.
It is about the HOT cable company in Israel (link specific *not* provided to avoid giving them any SEO).
The format of this repository is simple:

* Every file in the top level directory (besides this README) becomes a separate page on the website.
* Each file must have a .md file extension.
* Each file must be Markdown-formatted.
* The first line of each Markdown file will be used as the title of the page.
* The filename (minus the .md) will be the URL.

Was that confusing? If so, just look at any of the examples in this directory, it should explain it.
