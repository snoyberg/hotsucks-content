I've been living in Israel since 2009. In 2013, my parents *and* grandparents made aliya from the US.
Before they got here, I set them up with television, internet, and telephone, via the triple with HOT.
Since they didn't have teudot zehut, and since none of them spoke Hebrew, I set it up under my
ID and with my phone number.

Fast forward a year later. My parents have added a room to their house, and call up HOT to get that room
added with a new converter box. Three separate technicians all fail to install it correctly. So my
parents call YES, who gets them converted immediately. My parents proceeded to call HOT to cancel.
That's where the problems started.

In one day, they called three times. Each time, they waited on hold for an hour. When a representative
answered, my parents asked if he/she spoke English. They were then immediately put *back* on hold,
and after an hour the line disconnected. If you do the math, HOT made my parents wait on hold for
__six hours in one day__.

Not wanting to bother me with something this mundane, my parents called their credit card company,
who told them to cancel their credit card. I then tried calling HOT myself to get this canceled.
I had no language barrier to deal with, so thought this would be simple.

I have since then called HOT approximately 8 times. I have *never* received a call back from them
when they promised one. They have scheduled three different pickup times for their equipment,
and have *not once* shown up. The only times I get a call from HOT are demands for more money,
and then ultimately when I created this website.

Out of fear of causing me legal problems (remember, the account's in my name), my parents even paid their random fees:
approximately 800 NIS of *extra payments* for service they never received. That hasn't stopped HOT.
I have had two separate managers at HOT refuse to call me back at appointed times. I have personally
spent upwards of 10 hours on the phone with them to date.

After all this, it became less time-intensive for me to actually create this entire web site than
to continue trying to chase them down. And that seems to have worked. So my recommendation is:
if HOT is causing you problems, start spamming social media about how terrible they are.

My goal is: when someone searches for "HOT Israel", "HOT cable", or "cable Israel", this website
will be one of the first three results. Help me make that happen!
