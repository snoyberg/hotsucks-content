Please, cancel my account already!

FIXME To be filled out

   I have been fighting with them for three months to agree to cancel my account.
   As recently as two weeks ago, they are still sending us bills.
   I have no fewer than <b>eight times</b> been told that I will get a call back from
   them within 24 hours.
   I have <i>not once</i> received a call back.

<p>I do, however, regularly receive threatening phone calls from random other people in HOT
   demanding to know why I haven't returned my cable boxes to them- which they have
   on <b>three separate occasions</b> missed appointments to pick up.
