Malice or incompetence?

When a company like HOT sends you charges after you've closed your account,
and hounds you for months to pay bills for service you never received,
it might seems like they're greedy, evil, malevolent, corporate thugs.
However, there's a fine line between malice and incompetence. Below is a
direct translation of a text message I just received from them, I'll let
you decide which side of the line they fall on.

> Dear customer, following up on your request to disconnect service,
we would like to update you that on 01/01/0001 between the hours of
00:00 and 00:00, a service technician will arrive for an individual
appointment and, if necessary, collect any equipment in your possession.
In the event that someone over 18 on that day and time will not be
available, you will be charged the fee of a removal visit.

Well, Jesus wasn't even 18 in year 1... I guess they're planning on
charging me then.
